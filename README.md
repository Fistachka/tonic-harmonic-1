# Octave and Unison - harmonic

In music theory when you play two notes separately in time, one after the other, it is called a melodic interval.

When you play two notes at the same time - this is a harmonic interval.

In this lesson we will learn to identify by ear tonic and tonic one octave above.
We will have one of the three options:

1️⃣  Two lower tonics playing at the same time. If there's no distance between notes (that is the same note is playing) this distance (or interval) is called a `Unison`

2️⃣ Two upper tonics playing at the same time. Upper `Unison`

3️⃣ Tonic and tonic one octave above. `Octave`

Try to guess which option is playing!
